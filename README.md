# Purrloiner
Purrloiner is a top-down game I created in C++ and SDL2, where you play as a cat burglar and aim for a high score by collecting milk. Be careful as the farm animals are not happy with your actions, and touching any of them will end your milk run.

# How to play
Using the WASD keys to move around, direct your character to try and touch the milk container in the farm to increase your score. You will have to dodge the farm animals moving around that are also chucking eggs at you or else the game will end. Aim for the highest score you can!

# Build
If you want to play this game yourself, all you need to do is to copy the project onto your device and run the Purrloiner.exe file.
